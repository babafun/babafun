# it's babafun
Hi! I'm babafun, a guy who likes making music, animations, and of course, coding games and tools!

I'm currently working on _bluemesh-rs_, a library in Rust that makes P2P Bluetooth-based games as easy as websockets!
I'm currently learning Rust and low-level data structures, because I realised that as simple as Python and JS is, it's wayyy too slow for me.
I'm looking for BlueMesh collaborators once I'm done with the first (v1.0.0) stable release.
Currently, I'm only collaborating with people I know in-person, but that will change in good time.

enjoy my projects i guess :)
